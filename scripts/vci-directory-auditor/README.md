# vci-directory-auditor

Management tools for the [VCI directory](https://github.com/the-commons-project/vci-directory/). Scripts in this project:
* create a snapshot (including issuer keys and revocation information) of the VCI directory, along with an audit log
* package snapshots into a redistributable directory snapshot

## Setup

Make sure [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) are installed on your system; the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version is recommended for both. [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is also needed to validate endpoint TLS configurations.

1. Get the source, for example using `git`
```
git clone -b main https://github.com/the-commons-project/vci-directory.git
cd vci-directory/scripts/vci-directory-auditor
```

2. Build the `npm` package
```
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Audit script

The audit script creates a snapshot (including issuer keys and revocation information) of the VCI directory, along with an audit log.

Usage:
```
npm run audit -- <options>
```
where `<options>` are:
- `-o, --outlog <outlog>`: output directory log storing directory issuer keys, TLS details, CRLs, and errors/warnings
- `-s, --outsnapshot <outsnapshot>`: output snapshot file storing directory issuer keys for non-erroneous issuers
- `-p, --previous <previous>`: directory log file from a previous audit, for comparison with current one
- `-a, --auditlog <auditlog>`: output audit file on the directory
- `-d, --dirpath <dirpath>`: path of the directory to audit, uses "../../vci-issuers.json" by default
- `-n, --notls`: do not run the TLS audit (using OpenSSL)
- `-v, --verbose`: verbose mode

For example, to audit the VCI directory stored in this repository, run:
```
npm run audit -- -d ../../vci-issuers.json
```

To create a directory snapshot `snapshot.json` (including issuer keys (and CRLs, if any)), a full directory log `today.json` (including issuer keys (and CRLs, if any), TLS config, and errors), and an audit log `audit.json` comparing it with a previous directory log `yesterday.json`, run:
```
npm run audit -- -d ../../vci-issuers.json -o today.json -s snapshot.json -p yesterday.json -a audit.json
```

### Packaging script

The packaging script builds a redistributable snapshot, incorporating new information collected by the audit script. The resulting snapshot is a JSON file containing the following properties:
* `directory`: URL of the directory source
* `time`: UTC timestamp from the last updated snapshot, in ISO 8601 date-time format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
* `issuerInfo`: array of:
  * `issuer`: issuer information copied from the directory
  * `keys`: JWK set retrieved from the issuer's `iss`
  * `crls`: CRL retrieved from the issuers's revocation endpoint, if advertized in the JWK
  * `lastRetrieved`: UTC timestamp when this entry was last retrieved, in ISO 8601 date-time format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)

The `issuerInfo` property is replaced by newer ones as the snapshot is updated. If an issuer info is not present in a snapshot update, it is kept in the assembled one; this allows temporarily unavailable issuers and archived issuers to be included in the redistributed snapshot (verifiers can filter data they deem too old using the `lastRetrieved` property).

Usage:
```
npm run assemble -- <options>
```
where `<options>` are:
- `-s, --snapshot <snapshot>`: path to the previous directory snapshot to update
- `-c, --current <current>`: path to current snapshot to integrate in the previous snapshot
- `-n, --new`: create a new directory snapshot from the current snapshot

To create a new redistributable directory snapshot `vci_snapshot.json` from a (e.g., daily) snapshot `snapshot.json` (created using the `audit` script above), run:
```
 npm run assemble -- --snapshot vci_snapshot.json --current snapshot.json --new
```

To update the redistributable directory snapshot `vci_snapshot.json` with a new (e.g., daily) snapshot `snapshot.json` (created using the `audit` script above), run:
```
 npm run assemble -- --snapshot vci_snapshot.json --current snapshot.json
```

## Checks

The audit tool does the following checks:
 - Parse the specified issuer directory. For each issuer:
   - Download and validate its JWK set
   - Check its default TLS connection configuration (see below)
   - If a CRL is specified in the JWK set, download and validate it
 - Output a directory log with the issuer JWK sets (and CRLs, if any), TLS configuration, and any detected errors
 - Output a directory snapshot with the issuer JWK sets (and CRLs, if any) for issuers without errors. This could be downloaded by SMART Health Card verifiers for offline validation
 - Audit the directory (optionally comparing to a previous log of the directory), and report:
   - The number of issuers
   - The number of added and deleted issuers
   - Issuer errors
   - Duplicated KIDs, issuer names, iss URLs

### TLS validation

This tool tests conformance with [IETF BCP 195](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp195), consisting of:
  - [RFC 7525](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7525): Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
  - [RFC 8996](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8996): Deprecating TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1

OpenSSL's `s_client` tool is used to connect to a specified server, testing the various aspects of the TLS connections. The following table summarizes the validated items.
